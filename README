This is an effort to order my usual preamble and allow others to use it.

I have divided it in several files.

djcobibh.sty: Bibliography and hyperlinks.
    colr    : Color settings and library.
    ftln    : Fonts.
    grph    : Graphics, technical drawing and mathematical plotting.
    lstb    : Lists and tables.
    math    : Basic mathematical typesetting and macro library.

Additionaly I included the package djcopresconf.sty, which is a module for
generate a simple presentation environment that allows you full control of
what are you doing, showing ways into generating your own complex macros to
generate presentation elements.

For this last one, I will upload later an example of presentation done with
it.

The idea of the packages is that they can be used without cross-dependence.

Please, if you have questions, just ask.
